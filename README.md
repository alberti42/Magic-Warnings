## Periodic Monitoring

To ensure **Magic Warnings** runs periodically, you can set up a **Launch Agent** to trigger the app in the background.

1. Download `org.alberti42.magic-warning-launcher.plist` and place it in your `~/Library/LaunchAgents/` directory.
2. Modify the `ProgramArguments` in the `.plist` file to reflect the actual location of the `Magic Warnings.app`:
   \`\`\`xml
   <key>ProgramArguments</key>
   <array>
       <string>/Applications/Magic Warnings.app/Contents/MacOS/applet</string>
   </array>
   \`\`\`
3. Load the Launch Agent using the following Terminal command:
   \`\`\`bash
   launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/org.alberti42.magic-warning-launcher.plist
   \`\`\`
   This will ensure the app runs periodically to monitor the battery status of your devices.
