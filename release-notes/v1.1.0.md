## What's new:

- The app has been rewritten from scratch as a native macOS app, making it more reliable and efficient.
- Now runs natively on both Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3) and Intel Macs.
- When you open Magic Warnings for the first time, the background monitor is set up automatically — no manual steps required. A notification confirms it is active.
- No more false alarms for devices that are plugged in: warnings are only sent for devices connected via Bluetooth. If a device is charging over USB, it is silently skipped.
- The app no longer interrupts what you are doing when it runs its checks in the background; this happened before if you were pressing CTRL key.
